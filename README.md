## electr readme

electr is an R package used for converting party votes in elections into parliamentary seats according to Czech election law, specifically Act N. 247/1995 Coll (as amended by Act N. 189/2021 Coll.). It is currently capable of calculating seat distributions according to the current electoral law, as well as according to the mechanism used between 2002 and 2021 (Act N. 37/2002 Coll.).

Planned features:

-   Resolution mechanism for vote remainder ties (ยง50/4 or ยง51/3,4)
-   Historical seat distribution mechanisms (1996 Election Act version, potentially others)
-   Separate thresholds for coalitions

The package comes with two datasets of party vote gains in the 2017 and 2021 Chamber of Deputies elections, called psp17 and psp21.
