## electr readme

electr is an experimental R package used for converting party votes in elections into seats according to Czech electoral laws, specifically Law no. 247/1995 (189/2021). Currently, the package is capable of correctly converting the results of the 2021 elections. Planned features include the ability to account for all potential contingencies such as vote remainder ties (ยง50/4 or ยง51/3,4) and the inclusion of historical seat distribution mechanisms (1996 and 2002).

The package comes with a dataset of party vote gains in the 2021 Chamber of Deputies election, called psp21.
